    <h1>Abstract on Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>AbstractArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field of computer science that focuses on creating machines capable of simulating human intelligence. It involves the design of algorithms and systems that enable computers to perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and natural language understanding. The core objective of AI is to replicate cognitive functions that were once thought to be unique to human beings, thereby creating systems that can act autonomously and intelligently.</p>
